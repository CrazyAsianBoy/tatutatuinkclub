### Step one : 
User choose a frame of their liking
<br>
### Step two : 
User choose the inner design that fits the frame
### Step three : 
User can scroll through variety of designs (Mix & Match)

This post light a spark in my brain to create an app for it. This app is very simple, you have two options where you can scroll through the frames and inner designs by clicking the next and previous buttons. Here is how it looks like :

I have deployed the app on Netlify. You can try it here : <a href="http://tatutatu.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Tatutatuink App</a>

if you want to install it on your Android phone as an app, you can open the netlify link on your chrome browser and click the three dotted menu (burger button) and choose Add to Home Screen.
